#  Card Sets ReadMe

The set archives listed here serve as a starting point to create your own card sets.

Sets are created as .zip files. To create a valid zip file, select the INDIVIDUAL FILES (the folder, 
the set file and the import file) and combine them to a zip file. Make sure to not use a folder name
previously used, or the import will fail (directory name collision).

You can freely use these sets as a baseline for creating your own sets. A banner is, although included
here, not required. Just add "nil" in den IconPath field of your set file. Not filling fields will render
them invalid, causing the import to fail.
