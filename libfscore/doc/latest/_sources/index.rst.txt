libfscore is an open source library which is intended to provide core 
functionality for both card loading and set management. The library is meant 
to support as many host platforms as possible without incorporating orther 
3rd party libraries, relying on the standard programming language libraries 
only if possible.

This documentation includes listings for the internal functions, enumerations, 
etc. used by the library itself. These are not meant to be used directly for 
application development but as information for library development.

As such, this documentation is both aimed at developers wanting to write their 
own apps as well as library developers wishing to improve on the libfscore 
source.
